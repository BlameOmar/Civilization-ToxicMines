# Toxic Mines

Toxic Mines is a mod for Civilization 6 that degrades food yields on and around tiles with polluting
improvements. As your civilization industrializes, your improvements will start to produce more pollution
and further affect food yields. Eventually, your citizens will start caring about their  **Cultural Heritage**
and make an effort to minimize the amount of pollution.

## Pollution Sources
* Mines (after **Apprenticeship** is researched).
* Oil wells and offshore oil rigs.

## Pollution Effects
* **Apprenticeship**: Food yields on mines (except niter and salt mines) are reduced by 1.
* **Industrialization**: Food yields on mines (except niter and salt mines) and on tiles adjacent to mines
  are further reduced by 1 until **Cultural Heritage** is researched.
* Food yields on oil wells and offshore oil rigs are reduced by 1.
* Food yields on oil wells and offshore oil rigs, and on tiles adjacent to oil wells or offshore oil rigs
  are further reduced by 1 until **Cultural Heritage** is researched.
